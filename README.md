## UX and UI

### Site goals
The aim of the website is to spread awareness for mental health issues and challenges and provide the user with access to resources for
emergency contacts or self development.

### Design Choices
Due to the site goals we want to encourage users to view the resources and contacts but also raise awareness of the issues. Therefore, I have
incldued links to resources and support in the nav bar and footer but also buttons on the main page to both resources.html and support.html and 
from resources.html to support.html. Furthermore to raise awareness and education on mental health the main index.html page includes sections on
key questions and issues.

### User stories
Throughout the development process these user stories where on a project board in the github repository.

## Future Features
**Careers transition page** - a future feature that I had included in the could-have user stories was a careers transiton page.
This page would include advice and resources specifically for changing jobs or progressing in careeer that help to manage the
stress and mental challenges that someone may face. This page would include the same navigation bar and footer and would also
have a button and prompts for the emergency contacts section.

## Known Bugs
A minor issue is that on ipads the *get support* button on the index.html hero section would be easier to see using a dark bootstrap
button instead of the dark-outline button. So I would change the button on small screens and keep it the same on large screens.
