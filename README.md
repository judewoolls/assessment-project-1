## Deployment

## Future Features
**Careers transition page** - a future feature that I had included in the could-have user stories was a careers transiton page.
This page would include advice and resources specifically for changing jobs or progressing in careeer that help to manage the
stress and mental challenges that someone may face. This page would include the same navigation bar and footer and would also
have a button and prompts for the emergency contacts section.
